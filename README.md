# FRUITS CLASSIFIER

This is Multiclass Image classification project in which using Convolutional Neural Network will try to classify Fruits images

## DATA- 
>* data contains Training_set and test_set 
>>* Training_set:-
>>>* 81 classes of fruits 
>>>* Each contains approx 450-500 images 
>>* Test_set:-
>>>* also contains 81 category fruits
>>>* with 140-190 images

## Training:-
>* Used similar architecture as VGG16 (To view architecture see model.txt file)
>* At 7th Epoch got - loss: 0.1583 - accuracy: 0.9482 - val_loss: 0.3709 - val_accuracy: 0.9059
